Various Dotfiles and Configs
############################

This should be mostly self-explainitory, but I have recieved a few requsts to
post my configurations and I have been meaning to for some time.

I tried to create a quick cheat sheet in the the first 26 lines of most files
this could in theory be accessed by "helpy" in the bashrc file. Most dot files
begin with the word "dot" so that way they are not hidden from view. For 
example this could prevent the very annoying case when .semver is hidden in
repository and you really don't know that its there until after you made a 
commit.
